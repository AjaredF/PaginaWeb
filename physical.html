            Common love isn't for us<br>
            We created something phenomenal<br>
            Don't you agree? Don't you agree?<br>
            You got me feeling diamond-rich<br>
            Nothing on this planet compares to it<br>
            Don't you agree? Don't you agree?<br>
            <br>
            Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?<br>
            <br>
            All night, I'll riot with you<br>
            I know you got my back, and you know I got you<br>
            So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            Lights out, follow the noise<br>
            Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice<br>
            So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            <br>
            Adrenaline keeps on rushing in<br>
            Love the simulation we're dreaming in<br>
            Don't you agree? Don't you agree?<br>
            I don't wanna live another life<br>
            'Cause this one's pretty nice<br>
            Living it up<br>
            <br>
            Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?<br>
            <br>
            All night, I'll riot with you<br>
            I know you got my back, and you know I got you<br>
            So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            Lights out, follow the noise<br>
            Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice<br>
            So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            <br>
            Hold on just a little tighter<br>
            Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready<br>
            Come on (come on, come on)<br>
            Baby, keep on dancing<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            <br>
            Hold on just a little tighter<br>
            Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready<br>
            Come on (come on, come on)<br>
            Baby, keep on dancing<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            <br>
            All night, I'll riot with you<br>
            I know you got my back, and you know I got you<br>
            So come on, come on, come on<br>
            Let's get physical<br>
            <br>
            Lights out, follow the noise<br>
            Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice<br>
            So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on<br>
            Let's get physical (physical, physical)<br>
            <br>
            Let's get physical (physical, physical)<br>
            Physical (physical, physical)<br>
            Let's get physical (physical, physical)<br>
            Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical<br>
