            When we talk about, everything that happened<br>
            Would rather sit around, I don't need a lesson<br>
            You'd just call me out, call me when I'm distant<br>
            Always run your mouth, I don't wanna listen<br>
            <br>
            You're on my case (mhm)<br>
            Won't you stop with that look on your face?<br>
            And I can't believe (mhm)<br>
            That you only hold me when I'm on my knees<br>
            <br>
            Got me so tied up, when you push my luck<br>
            Thought you wanted this to last for life<br>
            Got me so fed up, when you talk too much<br>
            When your focus is all out of line<br>
            <br>
            When we talk about everything that happened<br>

            Uh-huh, oh, oh<br>
            <br>
            All the shit you put me through, put me through<br>
            And now you're talkin' 'bout me too<br>
            And I know that I could never get away from you<br>
            Yeah, I'll wait for you to turn around and talk it through<br>
            But we won't<br>
